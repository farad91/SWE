Group 2 additional informations and scons changes
-------------------------------------------------

Added the options: block, SWE_dimsplit, method and scenario to scons options.
block=dimsplit compiles swe_simple with our block implementation.
SWE_dimsplit=true compiles with our replacement of swe_simple.cpp.(requires block=dimsplit).
method=runTimestep just effects swe_simple and improves performance of our block implementation in this content. 
for more information see: scons --help 

in folder src/testing there is a scons script to build the unit tests
